There are two common versions of this task: timed and untimed.</p> <p>Timed GJT: In a timed GJT, participants are given a set time limit to decide whether a sentence is grammatically correct or not. This version of the task is used to measure not only accuracy but also the speed of participants\u2019 grammatical intuition. The time pressure aims to limit overthinking and encourage reliance on automatic language processing, which can be particularly enlightening when assessing implicit knowledge of grammar rules in a second language.</p> <p>Untimed GJT: The untimed GJT allows participants to take as long as they need to make their grammaticality judgments. This version is thought to reflect both explicit and implicit knowledge, as participants have more time to apply learned rules consciously. Untimed GJT can be preferable when testing individuals who might need more time to process the language, such as beginner learners or those with less exposure to the target language.</p> <p>How to use GJT in a study on second language acquisition:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Select Target Structures: Decide which grammatical features you want to test.

The essence of the EIT is to measure the learners' ability to reproduce accurately a presented stimulus sentence, which can provide indirect evidence of their language processing abilities and grammatical competence.</p> <p>How the Elicited Imitation Test works:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Stimulus Preparation: You prepare a set of sentences that vary in grammatical complexity and are representative of the language structures you are interested in assessing. These sentences should gradually increase in length and complexity to measure different proficiency levels.</p> </li> <li> <p>Oral Presentation: In a typical EIT, each sentence is presented orally to the participants, either through a recording or read aloud by the researcher. It is crucial to ensure that the audio quality is high and that the pace and intonation are neutral.</p> </li> <li> <p>Imitation Task: After hearing the sentence, participants are asked to repeat it exactly as they heard it. The imitation can either be produced immediately after hearing the sentence or after a brief pause.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recording Responses: The participants' responses are audio-recorded for later transcription and analysis.</p> </li> <li> <p>Timing: In the timed version of the test, participants may have a fixed amount of time to respond after hearing the stimulus sentence. Timing can add a layer of difficulty and may prompt reliance on automatic language processing rather than allowing time for reflection and analysis, which taps into implicit knowledge of the language.</p> </li> </ol> <p>How to Use Elicited Imitation Test in a Second Language Acquisition Study:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Defining Your Research Questions: Determine what specific aspects of language proficiency you wish to assess. This could include syntax, verb conjugation, tense use, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Participant Selection: Choose participants that represent the population you are studying. Often these will be learners of varying proficiency in the target language.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter Setting: Decide whether the test will be timed or untimed, and establish any other control parameters, such as the environment in which the test will be taken.</p> </li> <li> <p>Administering the Test: Present the sentences to each participant under consistent conditions. Ensure that any time limits imposed are strictly adhered to for the timed version.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Collection: Record the participants' reproductions for analysis. You may need a system for classifying and scoring their responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Analysis: Transcribe the recorded imitations and analyze them for accuracy. Mistakes or omissions can be categorized and analyzed to determine patterns of error related to the grammatical features being tested.</p> </li> <li> <p>Interpretation: Use the data to draw conclusions about the participants' language proficiency. Consider the implications for models of second language acquisition, particularly how imitation performance corresponds with other measures of language proficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reporting: Present the methodology and findings in a research paper or presentation. EIT can offer unique insight into the automaticity and accuracy of a learner's language processing, which may correlate with different stages of language acquisition.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Elicited Imitation Tests, and especially their timed variants, can be particularly useful for targeting the automatic, procedural aspects of language knowledge, which is often a research focus in studies of second language acquisition.
