### ABX Discrimination task

The ABX Discrimination task is a type of discrimination test used in various fields, including linguistics, psychology, and sensory evaluation. In this task, participants are presented with two samples, A and B, one of which is a control sample, while the other is a modified sample. The participant is then presented with a third sample, X, and is asked to identify which of the two initial samples, A or B, X most closely resembles. This task is commonly used to assess the ability of participants to discriminate between different stimuli and is often used in sensory evaluation research to determine differences in food or beverage products.
