This task measures learnersâ€™ ability to how quickly and accurately they can recognize printed words. The test was developed by (Mather, Hammill, Allen, & Roberts, 2004)

The Test of Silent Word Reading Fluency (TOSWRF) is a standardized test designed to assess an individual's ability to read words quickly and accurately without vocalizing them. It is intended for use with individuals who are at least eight years old and is particularly useful for assessing reading fluency in individuals with reading difficulties, such as dyslexia.

The TOSWRF consists of a list of words that the test taker is asked to read silently as quickly and accurately as possible. The words are presented in a random order, and the test is timed. The test taker's score is based on the number of words they read correctly within a set time limit.

The TOSWRF has been shown to have high reliability and validity and can provide valuable information about an individual's reading fluency and potential reading difficulties. It can be used by educators, psychologists, and other professionals to inform instructional planning and interventions.
