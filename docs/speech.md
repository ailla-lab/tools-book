# Speech

# Shadowing task

The task is used to measure speech segmentation. In this task, participants listen to short excerpts of speech and repeat as many words as they could.
(Mitterer & McQueen 2009)

## Animacy Judgment

The task is used to assess the speed of lexical access. Participants are presented with some word stimuli and are prompted to decide, as fast as possible, whether words identified either a living (e.g., dog) or nonliving (e.g., chair) item by pressing either the right or left shift key on the computer keyboard.
(Segalowitz & Frenkiel-Fishman, 2005).

## Sentence Verification Task

This task measure speed of processing L2 speech. Participants listen to several short sentences and decide if it is true or false. The time needed to repose is used as a measure of processing speed.

## Elicited Imitation

This task is considered a reliable and quick assessment of holistic speaking ability and implicit grammar knowledge (Ortega et al., 2002) (Isbell & Son, 2021)

## Written Elicited Imitation

    (García–Amaya & Cintrón–Valentín, 2021)

## Picture drawing task

Participants are asked to draw a picture to illustrate their understanding of reading texts, videos, or other stimuli. The task can help induce top-down meaning-oriented input processing and trigger participants’ meaning-based input processing (Hsieh & Tsai, 2017). It was used in SLA in this study (Lee et al., 2021)
