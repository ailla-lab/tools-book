## Shadowing task

Shadowing is a language learning technique that involves listening to a native speaker or a recorded voice and repeating what is said as quickly and accurately as possible. The goal of shadowing is to improve pronunciation, fluency, and overall speaking ability in a foreign language. The technique involves closely following the speaker's intonation, rhythm, and stress patterns, and attempting to replicate them as closely as possible. Shadowing can be done with a variety of materials, including audio recordings, videos, and live speakers. The technique is often used in language classrooms and language learning programs, and can be done individually or in groups. Shadowing is a highly effective technique for improving speaking skills, as it helps learners to develop their listening comprehension, pronunciation, and overall fluency in a foreign language.

The task is used to measure speech segmentation. In this task, participants listen to short excerpts of speech and repeat as many words as they could.

## Animacy Judgment

Animacy judgment is a task used in psycholinguistics and cognitive science to investigate how people process and categorize objects based on their perceived animacy. The task involves presenting participants with a series of objects or images and asking them to rate the perceived animacy of each object or image on a scale. The scale typically ranges from inanimate to animate, with intermediate categories such as partially animate or quasi-animate. The task is designed to test the hypothesis that people process animate objects differently from inanimate objects, and that this processing may be influenced by factors such as movement, intentionality, and agency. Animacy judgment tasks have been used in a variety of studies, including studies of language acquisition, semantic processing, and social cognition. The task is often used in conjunction with other measures, such as reaction time or brain imaging, to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying animacy perception and processing.

The task is used to assess the speed of lexical access. Participants are presented with some word stimuli and are prompted to decide, as fast as possible, whether words identified either a living (e.g., dog) or nonliving (e.g., chair) item by pressing either the right or left shift key on the computer keyboard.

## Sentence Verification Task

This task measure speed of processing L2 speech. Participants listen to several short sentences and decide if it is true or false. The time needed to repose is used as a measure of processing speed.

## Elicited Imitation

This task is considered a reliable and quick assessment of holistic speaking ability and implicit grammar knowledge (Ortega et al., 2002) (Isbell & Son, 2021)

## Written Elicited Imitation

Written Elicited Imitation (WEI) is a language learning technique that involves reading and reproducing written text in the target language. In a WEI task, the learner reads a passage of written text in the target language and then reproduces it, either orally or in writing, as closely as possible to the original text.

The goal of a WEI task is to improve the learner's ability to comprehend and produce written language in the target language. WEI tasks can be used to improve various aspects of language learning, such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and sentence structure.

WEI tasks can be done individually or in groups, and can be adapted to different levels and types of language learners. They can be done with different types of written text, such as articles, stories, or dialogues, and can be tailored to specific language learning goals or contexts.

WEI tasks have been found to be effective in improving language learning outcomes, especially when combined with other language learning techniques, such as explicit instruction, feedback, and practice. They can be a valuable tool for language learners who want to improve their written language skills and to build their confidence in using the language.

## Picture drawing task

The picture drawing task is a research method used in psychology, cognitive science, and other fields to investigate visual perception, memory, and creativity. The task involves asking participants to draw a picture based on a verbal or written prompt, such as a word or a short phrase. The prompt can be either concrete or abstract, and can be related to a specific topic or theme. Participants are typically given a set amount of time to complete the drawing, and are encouraged to be as creative as possible.

The picture drawing task is often used in studies of visual perception and memory, as it allows researchers to investigate how people represent and remember visual information. The task can also be used to investigate creativity, as it provides a measure of participants' ability to generate novel and original ideas.

The picture drawing task can be used in both laboratory and field settings, and can be adapted for use with different populations, including children, adults, and individuals with cognitive or developmental disabilities. The task can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as questionnaires or interviews, to gather additional information about participants' perceptions and experiences.

Overall, the picture drawing task is a flexible and versatile research method that can be used to investigate a wide range of topics related to visual perception, memory, and creativity.

Participants are asked to draw a picture to illustrate their understanding of reading texts, videos, or other stimuli. The task can help induce top-down meaning-oriented input processing and trigger participantsâ€™ meaning-based input processing (Hsieh & Tsai, 2017). It was used in SLA in this study (Lee et al., 2021)
