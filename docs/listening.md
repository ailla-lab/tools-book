## The Listening Span Test (LST)

The Listening Span Test (LST) is a cognitive assessment tool used to measure an individual's working memory capacity. It is a type of complex span task that requires the individual to listen to a series of spoken sentences and then recall the final word of each sentence in the correct order. The difficulty of the task increases as the number of sentences in each set increases. The LST is designed to measure an individual's ability to hold and manipulate information in working memory while also performing a secondary task, such as language comprehension. The LST is often used by psychologists and other professionals to assess working memory capacity in both clinical and research settings. The results of the LST can be used to identify individuals with working memory deficits and to develop appropriate interventions to improve working memory capacity.

## Listening Effort Scale (LES)

The Listening Effort Scale (LES) is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess the perceived effort required to listen to speech in various listening conditions. It is often used in audiology and speech-language pathology to evaluate the impact of hearing loss or other auditory processing disorders on listening effort. The LES consists of a series of statements related to listening effort, such as "I had to concentrate hard to understand what was being said" or "I felt mentally exhausted after listening." The individual is asked to rate the level of agreement with each statement on a Likert scale. The results of the LES can be used to identify listening conditions that are particularly challenging for the individual and to develop appropriate interventions to reduce listening effort, such as hearing aids or assistive listening devices. The LES can also be used to monitor changes in listening effort over time or to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions designed to reduce listening effort.
