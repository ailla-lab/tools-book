## **Word and Frequency Lists**

### <strong> The Academic Word List (AWL) </strong>

The Academic Word List (AWL) is a list of 570 word families that frequently appear in academic texts, but are not contained in the General Service List (GSL). The AWL was developed by Averil Coxhead at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, with the target readership being English as a second or foreign language students intending to enter English-medium higher education, and teachers of such students. The list is a very useful resource for English for Academic Purposes teachers and learners. The AWL includes lots of resources to practice using the AWL and developing knowledge of academic vocabulary.

The Academic Word List (AWL) was developed by Averil Coxhead. The list contains 570 word families which were selected because they appear with great frequency in a broad range of academic texts.

### <strong> The General Service List </strong>

The General Service List (GSL) is a list of approximately 2000 high-frequency words in English that are most commonly used in written and spoken communication. The GSL was developed by Michael West in the 1950s and is widely used in English language teaching and learning materials. The words on the GSL are considered essential for learners of English to know in order to communicate effectively in a variety of contexts. The list includes words such as "the", "and", "but", "good", "bad", "happy", "sad", "big", "small", "important", "interesting", and many others. The GSL is often used as a basis for vocabulary instruction and assessment in English language classrooms, and is also used by researchers studying language acquisition and corpus linguistics.

### <strong> The New General Service List (NSGL) </strong>

The New General Service List (NGSL) is a list of the most frequent words in English, which was developed by Dr. Charles Browne, Dr. Brent Culligan, and Dr. Joseph Phillips. The NGSL contains 2800 word families, which make up approximately 92% of all the words in English. The NGSL is an updated version of the General Service List (GSL), which was created in the 1950s by Michael West. The NGSL is based on a large corpus of written and spoken English, and is intended for use in English language teaching and learning. The NGSL is organized into 10 levels, with each level containing approximately 280 word families. The NGSL is a valuable resource for English language learners and teachers, as it provides a solid foundation of the most important vocabulary in English.

The New General Service List (NGSL) is published by Dr. Charles Browne, Dr. Brent Culligan and Joseph Phillips and it contains 2,818 words (lemmas) claimed to be the core vocabulary of the English language.

### <strong> The New Academic Word List 1.0 (NAWL) </strong>

The New Academic Word List (NAWL) is a list of 963 word families that frequently appear in academic texts, which was developed by Charles Browne, Brent Culligan, and Joseph Phillips in 2013. The NAWL is an updated version of the Academic Word List (AWL), which was developed by Averil Coxhead in 2000. The NAWL is based on a corpus of academic texts, and is intended for use in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) teaching and learning. The NAWL includes definitions, examples, and collocations for each word family, as well as exercises and activities for learners to practice using the words in context. The NAWL is a valuable resource for EAP teachers and learners, as it provides a targeted list of academic vocabulary that is essential for success in academic settings.

The New Academic Word List (NAWL) was developed by Charles Browne, Brent Culligan and Joseph Phillips in 2013. The NAWL is based on a carefully selected academic corpus of 288 million words.

### <strong> BNC Frequency List </strong>

The BNC Frequency List is a compilation of the most frequently used words in the British National Corpus (BNC), a large collection of written and spoken texts in British English. The list is designed to aid learners of English as a foreign language and includes vocabulary for foreign travel, study in English, and the internet. Several versions of the frequency list are available, including a lemmatized version and a raw version, and they can be found on various websites such as Kilgarriff's webpage. The list has been used to design graded readers and course books.

### <strong> Knowledge-based Vocabulary Lists </strong>

"The KVL lists were created by testing English language word knowledge of over 100,000 Chinese, German, and Spanish learners of English in order to determine which words were known best and which were less well known. The test required the learners to spell the words correctly, and so required a good level of mastery." There are currently three KVL for L2 learners: KVL-Chinese, KVL-German, or KVL-Spanish. The lists are available for download at

## **Vocabulary knowledge Tests**

### <strong> Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) </strong>

The Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT) is a standardized test used to measure a person's receptive vocabulary, or the number of words they understand when they are presented in context. The test is based on the idea that words can be grouped into levels of difficulty, with each level representing a range of words that are similar in terms of their frequency of use and complexity. The VLT consists of 80 multiple-choice questions, each with a sentence containing a target word and four possible definitions. The test-taker must choose the definition that best fits the context of the sentence. The VLT is often used in research to measure the vocabulary size of individuals and groups, and to compare vocabulary development across different populations. It is also used in language assessment and teaching to determine a learner's level of vocabulary knowledge and to set goals for vocabulary instruction.

Rationale for Version C above: Cobb, T. (2000), One size fits all? Canadian Modern Language Review, 57(2), 295-324.

### <strong> Updated Vocabulary Levels Test (UVLT) </strong>

The UVLT consists of five levels measuring knowledge of vocabulary at the 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 levels. Items for the tests were sourced from Nation’s (2012) BNC/COCA word lists. The test has two forms ...

### <strong> Vocabulary Size Test (VST) </strong>

The Vocabulary Size Test developed by Paul Nation and David Beglar is a widely used tool to estimate the size of an individual's vocabulary in English. The test consists of 140 multiple-choice items, each with four possible answers. The words included in the test range from the most common to the least common, based on frequency data from the British National Corpus.

The test is designed to assess receptive vocabulary knowledge, which means that test takers are asked to select the correct meaning of a word from a list of options, rather than producing the word themselves. The test is timed, with a suggested time limit of 50 minutes to complete all 140 items.

The Vocabulary Size Test developed by Nation and Beglar has been used in various research studies and has been shown to have high reliability and validity. It has also been used to estimate vocabulary size in different contexts, such as second language learners and academic settings.

### <strong> Computer Adaptive Test of Size & Strength (CATSS) </strong>

CATSS aims to assess vocabulary size, i.e. knowledge of word meaning. However, in an attempt to overcome the basic limitation of size tests by testing each word in more detail, four degrees of strength of knowledge are assessed. Each word is tested in four modalities
(i.e. productive recall, receptive recall, productive recognition, receptive recognition), as demonstrated using the word ‘melt’ below.

### <strong> Picture Vocabulary Size Test (PVST) </strong>

The Picture Vocabulary Size Test (PVST) is a test of receptive vocabulary size. The test measures whether the test-taker can find a suitable meaning (a picture) for a given partly contextualized word form. It is a recognition test primarily intended for young pre-literate native speakers up to eight years old and young non-native speakers of English. Two 96-item test sets are included with the test. These test sets use different questions but following the same design procedures. The PVST was designed by Paul Nation of Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand and implemented as a software package by Laurence Anthony of Waseda University, Japan. Jannie van Hees of The University of Auckland, New Zealand played an important role in trialing the test

### <strong> The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test </strong>

The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) is a standardized test that measures receptive vocabulary in children and adults. The test was first published in 1959 by Lloyd M. Dunn and Leota M. Dunn, and has since been revised multiple times. The PPVT assesses an individual's understanding of spoken words by presenting them with a series of pictures and asking them to point to the picture that corresponds with the word they hear. The test is designed to be administered one-on-one and takes approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. The PPVT is commonly used in educational and clinical settings to assess language development and to identify potential language delays or disorders. The test has been translated into multiple languages and is widely used in research on language acquisition and development.

(PPVT; Dunn & Dunn, 2007)

### <strong> Word Part Levels Test (WPLT) </strong>

The Word Part Levels Test (WPLT) is a vocabulary test developed by Yosuke Sasao and Stuart Webb. It measures learners' knowledge of the meanings and uses of word parts, such as prefixes, suffixes, and roots, in English. WPLT measures three aspects of affix knowledge: form (recognition of written affix forms), meaning (knowledge of affix meanings), and use (knowledge of the syntactic properties of affixes)

The WPLT consists of 60 multiple-choice items, each with four possible answers. The test items are designed to assess learners' ability to recognize and use word parts in context. The test is divided into three levels: Level 1 tests knowledge of common prefixes and suffixes, Level 2 tests knowledge of less common word parts and roots, and Level 3 tests knowledge of more complex word parts and their meanings.

The WPLT has been shown to have high reliability and validity, and it has been used in various research studies to assess vocabulary knowledge and to guide vocabulary instruction. The test can be used with learners at different levels of proficiency and in different contexts, such as academic and professional settings.

### <strong> Guessing from Context Test (GCT) </strong>

The Guessing from Context Test is a language assessment tool that measures a person's ability to understand the meaning of words or phrases based on the context in which they are used. In this test, a person is presented with a sentence or a paragraph that contains a word or phrase that they may not be familiar with. The person is then asked to guess the meaning of the word or phrase based on the context of the sentence or paragraph. This type of test is often used to assess a person's reading comprehension skills and their ability to use context clues to understand unfamiliar words or phrases. The Guessing from Context Test is a useful tool for educators and language professionals to evaluate a person's language proficiency and to identify areas where they may need additional support or instruction.

### <strong> Meaning recall task </strong>

The Meaning Recall Task is a research method used to investigate how people process and remember words and their meanings. In this task, participants are presented with a list of words and asked to recall their meanings. The words can be presented in various ways, such as written or spoken, and can be presented in isolation or in context. After a short delay, participants are asked to write down or say the meanings of the words they remember from the list. This task is often used in studies of vocabulary acquisition and retention, and can help researchers understand how different factors, such as word frequency, context, and personal interest, affect word learning and memory. The Meaning Recall Task can also be adapted to investigate other aspects of word processing, such as word recognition, semantic priming, and word association. Overall, the Meaning Recall Task is a useful tool for investigating the cognitive processes involved in vocabulary learning and use.

The Complete Lexical Tutor is widely used in language teaching and learning contexts, as well as in research on vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension.

### <strong> Vocabulary-Recognition Test </strong>

The Vocabulary-Recognition Test is a standardized test used to measure a person's receptive vocabulary, or the number of words they understand when they are presented in isolation. The test is based on the idea that words can be recognized and understood even if they are not used in context. The Vocabulary-Recognition Test consists of a list of words, each presented one at a time, and the test-taker must indicate whether they know the meaning of each word or not. The test is often used in research to measure the vocabulary size of individuals and groups, and to compare vocabulary development across different populations. It is also used in language assessment and teaching to determine a learner's level of vocabulary knowledge and to set goals for vocabulary instruction. However, it should be noted that the Vocabulary-Recognition Test only measures receptive vocabulary and does not assess a person's ability to use words effectively in communication.

### <strong> Phonological Familiarity judgments </strong>

Phonological familiarity judgments are a research method used to investigate how people perceive and process speech sounds. In this task, participants are presented with pairs of words that differ in their phonological properties, such as vowel length, stress pattern, or consonant voicing. The participants are then asked to judge which of the two words is more familiar or more commonly used in their language. This task is often used in studies of phonological processing and word recognition, and can help researchers understand how different phonological features affect word perception and memory. The task can also be adapted to investigate other aspects of phonological processing, such as phoneme discrimination, phonological awareness, and speech perception in noise. Overall, phonological familiarity judgments are a useful tool for investigating the cognitive processes involved in speech perception and language processing.

### Orthographic Familiarity judgments

Orthographic familiarity judgments are a research method used to investigate how people perceive and process written words. In this task, participants are presented with pairs of words that differ in their spelling, such as words with irregular spellings, homophones, or words with different letter combinations. The participants are then asked to judge which of the two words is more familiar or more commonly used in their language. This task is often used in studies of orthographic processing and word recognition, and can help researchers understand how different orthographic features affect word perception and memory. The task can also be adapted to investigate other aspects of orthographic processing, such as phoneme-grapheme correspondence, visual word recognition, and spelling ability. Overall, orthographic familiarity judgments are a useful tool for investigating the cognitive processes involved in reading and written language processing.

### Connectives task

The task assesses learners’ knowledge of connectives (Crosson & Lesaux, 2013). In this untimed cloze task, learners are asked to read a short passage that are missing connectives and choose the connective that appropriately link two sentences or clauses. For example,

### Word Associates Test

The Word Associates Test is a research method used to investigate the semantic associations between words. In this task, participants are presented with a list of words and asked to generate a list of words that are associated with each of the original words. The associations can be based on any semantic relationship, such as synonyms, antonyms, or related concepts. The Word Associates Test can be used to investigate a variety of research questions related to language and cognition, such as how people organize and retrieve information from memory, how different semantic relationships affect word processing, and how individual differences in semantic knowledge and memory affect language comprehension and production. The task can also be adapted to investigate other aspects of semantic processing, such as semantic priming, semantic similarity, and semantic categorization. Overall, the Word Associates Test is a useful tool for investigating the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying semantic processing and language comprehension.

The test is also used to measure second language learners' vocabulary depth with a focus on their network knowledge. To take the test, one can use online resources like the one provided by Lextutor.

### <strong> The Lexical Frequency Profile </strong>

The Lexical Frequency Profile (LFP) is a tool used to analyze the frequency of words in a text. It was developed by Michael McCarthy and Ronald Carter in their book "Language as Discourse: Perspectives for Language Teaching". The LFP is based on the idea that words in a text can be classified into different frequency bands based on how often they occur in a language. The LFP divides words into four frequency bands: high frequency, mid-high frequency, mid-low frequency, and low frequency. The tool is used to analyze the distribution of words across these frequency bands in a text. The LFP is useful for identifying the most common words in a text, as well as for identifying words that are less common and may require more attention in language teaching and learning. The LFP is widely used in corpus linguistics research, as well as in language teaching and learning to analyze and profile the vocabulary in a text.

(Laufer & Nation, 1995)

## <strong> The Depth of Vocabulary Knowledge Test (DVKT) </strong>

The Depth of Vocabulary Knowledge Test (DVKT) is a standardized test used to measure a person's depth of vocabulary knowledge, or the extent to which they understand the nuances and subtleties of words beyond their basic definitions. The test is based on the idea that words can be known at different levels of depth, ranging from a basic understanding of their meaning to a more complex understanding of their connotations, associations, and usage in different contexts. The DVKT consists of 40 multiple-choice questions, each with a sentence containing a target word and four possible interpretations. The test-taker must choose the interpretation that best reflects the word's deeper meaning in the given context. The DVKT is often used in research to assess the quality of vocabulary knowledge and to investigate the relationship between vocabulary depth and reading comprehension. It is also used in language teaching and assessment to identify areas of strength and weakness in learners' vocabulary knowledge and to guide instruction in vocabulary development.
