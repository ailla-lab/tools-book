### Knowledge-based Vocabulary Lists

"The KVL lists were created by testing English language word knowledge of over 100,000 Chinese, German, and Spanish learners of English in order to determine which words were known best and which were less well known. The test required the learners to spell the words correctly, and so required a good level of mastery." There are currently three KVL for L2 learners: KVL-Chinese, KVL-German, or KVL-Spanish.
