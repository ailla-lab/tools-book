# Morphology

## Real Word Decomposition Task

This task was developed by (Carlisle, 2000) to measure learnersâ€™ knowledge of morphology. In this task, learners are asked to extract the base form of a word with a derivational suffix (e.g., complexity > complex) to complete a sentence (e.g., the problem was \***\*\_\_\*\***).

## Nonword derivation task (NWDT)

The task is used to measure morphological awareness (Nagy et al., 2006). Learners are asked to complete a sentence (e.g., this boy is a great**\_\_** ) by choosing a nonsense word with appropriate derivational suffix (e.g., tranter) from among four choices (e.g., tranter, tranting, trantion, and traniful) (Kieffer & Lesaux, 2012)
