# Morphology

## <strong> Real Word Decomposition Task </strong>

a Real-Word Decomposition Task involves presenting learners with real (existing) complex words, which are typically compound or derived words, and asking them to break them down into their constituent morphemes. This could be done by identifying the root, prefixes, and suffixes.

For example, participants might be presented with the word "unbelievable," and the task would be to decompose this into "un-", "believe", and "-able", or asked to extract the base form of a word with a derivational suffix (e.g., complexity > complex) to complete a sentence (e.g., the problem was \***\*\_\_\*\***). Participants might be instructed to:

1. Identify the root or base word ("believe").
2. Identify the prefix that alters the meaning of the base word ("un-").
3. Identify the suffix that further modifies the meaning of the base word or changes its grammatical category ("-able").

### Purpose:

The purpose of this task could be to assess:

1. Morphological awareness: the understanding of the structure of words and the ability to reflect on and manipulate that structure.
2. Vocabulary knowledge: knowing not just individual words but components that make up many words.
3. Word-processing skills: the ability to quickly and accurately break down words into component morphemes, which might relate to reading comprehension and fluency.

In second language (L2) acquisition research, the Real-Word Decomposition Task can be used to investigate several aspects of language learning:

1. **Morphological Processing**: The task can provide insights into how L2 learners process morphologically complex words. Are they breaking them down similarly to native speakers, or are they using different strategies?

2. **Vocabulary Acquisition**: By analyzing the types of errors learners make, researchers may be able to understand which morphological features of the L2 are more difficult to acquire and why.

3. **Transfer of L1 Skills**: If participants are also tested in their first language (L1), researchers can look for transfer effects. Do learners with rich morphological systems in their L1 handle L2 morphological decomposition more effectively

## <strong> Nonword derivation task (NWDT) </strong>

The task, as its name suggests, involves deriving new words (nonwords) based on linguistic rules. While traditionally, nonword tasks might be used to assess phonological processing, a derivation task would focus on morphological rules.

### Description:

This task would require participants to form new words from provided nonwords by applying morphological rules typical of word formation in the target language. For example, learners of English might be given a nonword like "glorp" and asked to create a different form by adding a real suffix to make it into a noun, adjective, or verb ("glorpy", "glorpness", "to glorpen").

### Purpose:

- Assess morphological awareness: Understand the participant's ability to manipulate and understand morphological structures in the L2.
- Measure productive language skills: See how well participants can use linguistic rules to create new words.
- Test rule generalization: Assess whether participants over-generalize, under-generalize, or appropriately generalize grammatical rules when they form new words.

### Procedure:

1. **Preparation**: Create a list of non-words that quasi-resemble words in the target language but do not exist in the lexicon.
2. **Task presentation**: Present the nonwords to participants, either in written or spoken form, depending on the focus of the research.
3. **Instruction**: Give participants rules for derivational changes (e.g., adding a suffix to make a verb into a noun), or ask them to create derived forms that might pertain to hypothetical contexts.
4. **Control**: Use both nonwords and real words to evaluate the participants' morphological competences. This will also help control for other linguistic knowledge beyond derivation.

#### Using NWDT in Research:

- **Control group comparisons**: Compare responses from native speakers of the target language with L2 learners to identify differences in rule application and morphological processing.
- **L2 Proficiency impact**: Assess how morphological derivation skills vary among L2 learners at different proficiency levels.
- **Longitudinal studies**: Use the task to measure how learners' ability to manipulate morphological structures develops over time.
- **Language transfer effects**: Investigate if learners' L1 morphological structure influences their performance in the NWDT in the L2.
- **Neurolinguistic studies**: Pair the task with neuroimaging or other physiological measures to see which areas of the brain are activated during morphological processing.

### Data Analysis:

- **Accuracy**: Analyze correct vs. incorrect derivations.
- **Error patterns**: Look for systematic errors that might reveal underlying hypotheses or misconceptions about the L2 morphology.
- **Response times**: Measure how quickly participants are able to generate derived forms, which can give insight into the automaticity of their morphological processing.

Using such a task in second language research is particularly useful in studying the internalization of morphological rules and patterns, and in how learners come to manipulate these to produce theoretically infinite word forms, which is an essential aspect of language acquisition.

The task is used to measure morphological awareness (Nagy et al., 2006). Learners are asked to complete a sentence (e.g., this boy is a great**\_\_** ) by choosing a nonsense word with appropriate derivational suffix (e.g., tranter) from among four choices (e.g., tranter, tranting, trantion, and traniful) (Kieffer & Lesaux, 2012)
