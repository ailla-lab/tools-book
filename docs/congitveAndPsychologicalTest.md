## The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS)

The Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) is a self-report questionnaire designed to assess the level of anxiety experienced by individuals when learning a foreign language in a classroom setting. The FLCAS consists of a series of statements related to language learning anxiety, such as "I feel tense when I have to speak in a foreign language" or "I worry about making mistakes in front of others." The individual is asked to rate the level of agreement with each statement on a Likert scale. The FLCAS is often used in research studies to investigate the impact of anxiety on foreign language learning and to identify strategies for reducing anxiety in the classroom. The results of the FLCAS can also be used by language teachers to identify students who may be experiencing high levels of anxiety and to develop appropriate interventions to reduce anxiety and improve language learning outcomes.
